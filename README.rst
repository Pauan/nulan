How to run
==========

Just use ``./nulan`` to get to a REPL


Features
========

* A full-blown Lisp, which means programs are parsed as S-expressions, and there's a very heavy emphasis on "code is data is code"

* Pattern matching for function/macro arguments

* Hyper-static scope at both the global and function level

* Hygienic macros which are even easier to use than Arc/Common Lisp macros

* Syntax to make common idioms shorter and easier to read

* Compiles down to extremely fast JavaScript: it should be just as fast or faster than handwritten JS code
