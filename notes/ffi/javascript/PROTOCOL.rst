The ``PROTOCOL`` statement creates a new Nulan protocol, which only exists at
compile-time and does not have any effect on the FFI.

In addition, the ``PROTOCOL`` statement can create zero or more constants,
which also exist only at compile-time and do not have any effect on the FFI.

(See ``REQUIRE`` for more information)
